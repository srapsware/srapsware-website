Microsoft URL Rewrite module offers you similar functionality like Apache mod_rewrite module. It is fully integrated into the web.config file (an excellent equivalent of .htaccess file of Apache). URL Rewrite Module in IIS 7 (7.5 and 8.0) provides import feature that makes conversion of Apache mod_rewrite rules to IIS URL rewrite rules too easy. This module comes pre-installed with all AccuWebHosting Windows VPS, guest visitors who want to enable mod_rewrite on IIS can download the [Rewrite Module here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200803150118/https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite).

URL Rewrite Module tries to convert Apache mod_rewrite rules to equivalent IIS URL rewrite rules. However, due to architectural differences between Apache and IIS web servers, all mod_rewrite rules may not be converted. Hence, we recommend that you completely understand the rewrite rule functionality before you begin the conversion process. Once Apache mod_rewrite rules have been converted to IIS URL rewrite rules, verify that corresponding IIS rewrite rules function same as Apache rewrite rules.

1. Start IIS Manager (***Start*** >> ***Run***, type ***inetmgr*** and hit enter).![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200803150118im_/https://cdn.srapsware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/inetmgr.png)

You can change the rule name by selecting rule from Tree View, right-click on rule name, and select Rename from context menu.![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200803150118im_/https://cdn.srapsware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rename-rules.png)
