**The world's getting crazy for  Serverless Architecture**

We are pleased to announce that we have relocated our official website to Netlify and using Jekyll for page generation and using Netlify Headless CMS for managing Post, Portfolio and Testimonial and more.

**What are the benefits of this enhancement?** 

Now we are GitHub to host our files so saving the cost of hosting and directly deploying from GitHub so there is no loss of data or any speed related issues. 

1. Automation of development

2. Speed speed on website. [See here](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.srapsware.com/EouVaVIM/) our scores
