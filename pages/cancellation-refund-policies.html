   Srapsware Pvt. Ltd undertakes all projects under the scope of objectives that
   determine the direction / route followed by the project.
  </p>
  <p>
   All Web Design / Web Development / Mobile Application Development / Sofware
   Developemnt / Search Engine Optimization / Digital Marketing/Hosting
   Services/ Maintenance of a website are carried out and accepted after total
   analysis and creation of a complete scope document, in order to ensure that
   our teams have full understanding of the work needed to be done, eliminating
   possibilities of any project cancellation / reversal / dispute.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since Srapsware Pvt. Ltd and the client understand that there is work involved to
   achieve every milestone of the project and completion of every module, a
   refund would not be possible for the work once assigned to us.
  </p>
  <p>
   Payments for custom design projects / above services are made to us in
   increments by client is non-refundable. If a project is canceled or
   postponed, all charges paid are retained by Srapsware Pvt. Ltd and if applicable,
   a fee for all work completed beyond what was already paid for shall be paid
   by the client.
  </p>
  <p>
   If we receive a chargeback or payment dispute (i.e. PayPal Dispute) from a
   credit card company or bank, your service and/or project will be suspended
   without notice. A $50 chargeback fee (issued to recover fees passed on to us
   by the credit company), plus any outstanding balances accrued as a result of
   the chargeback(s) must be paid in full before service is restored, files
   delivered, or any further work is done. Instead of issuing a chargeback,
   contact us to address any billing issues. Requesting a chargeback or opening
   a PayPal dispute for a valid charge from us is fraud, and is never an
   appropriate or legal means of obtaining a refund. Please read and make sure
   you fully understand our refund policy prior to making a payment.
  </p>
  <p>
   We are willing to work with you and after getting confirmation from your
   side, we immediately take action on it and send your work in progress.
   Therefore, if you take your steps back after confirmation, so, the amount you
   have already paid is non-refundable. We interact with our clients and do our
   best to solve all their queries and start work after their approval,
   therefore, there is no provision for any kind of refund. We clearly mentioned
   that the paid amount is non-refundable in any circumstance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Please read and make sure you fully understand our refund and cancellation
   policy prior to making a payment. Should you have other questions about our
